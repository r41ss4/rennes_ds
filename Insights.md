##  Findings and Insights

In an increasingly saturated beauty market, understanding what customers value—and what they reject—is more essential than ever. This project applies clustering and sentiment analysis to Sephora product and review data to uncover which attributes truly drive customer satisfaction. From ingredient preferences to brand perceptions, our findings provide clear signals for marketing, product development, and strategic positioning. These insights empower brands to align offerings with consumer expectations more effectively.###  Key Insights from the Analysis:

### Customer Sentiment Patterns (Sentiment Analysis)

- Products with **high sentiment polarity (> 0.5)**—such as *Extra Repair Moisture Cream* (Bobbi Brown) and *Revitalizing Supreme+ Creme* (Estée Lauder)—tend to be associated with **hydrating**, **soothing**, and **luxurious-feeling** formulations. These products are not only top-rated but also emotionally appreciated, with strong brand trust and positive word-of-mouth.

- Conversely, products with **negative polarity (< 0)**—like *Mini Must Haves Skincare Set* (Bobbi Brown) or *NuBODY – Body Toning Device* (NuFACE)—often reflect **unmet expectations**, **performance doubts**, or **pricing concerns**. Despite high “loves_count” or brand prestige, sentiment reveals a deeper layer of dissatisfaction.

- **Polarity analysis provides a more nuanced view** than star ratings alone, uncovering emotional reactions that guide customer loyalty or churn.

- The gap between high and low performers emphasizes the need for **clear product claims**, **realistic expectations**, and **customer education**, especially for high-investment or treatment-oriented products.
